       "\"## FROM SOVEREIGNTY TO EXTRATERRITORIAL CONSCIOUSNESS\\n\\n\\nSince 1997, the concept of extraterritoriality has been configured in the political tension between Hong Kong and Beijing. From the perspective of the Central Government, it is fundamental for the people of China to shijian zhuquan instantiate its sovereignty over Hong Kong. But while most Hong / Kong residents insist on interpreting this concept in terms of the Euro-American notion of selfdetermination  (zizhu / making decisions  for  oneself),  the  Beijing  government  believes  that  the Hong Kong legislature must make decisions in conformation to the larger will of the people, which the Party represents, a concept taken from the writings of Lenin and Stalin (Gao 2010: 26-30). This tension is crystalised in the long debate about Article 23 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, which requires  the  SAR  to  'enact  laws  on  its  own  to  prohibit  any  act  of  treason,  secession,  sedition, subversion  against  the  Central  People's  Government'  (China  1995  [1991]:  8-9;  Hong  Kong Human Rights Monitor 2004), and the Occupy Central movement demanding for the Hong Kong residents' right to nominate candidates for the Chief Executive election in 2017. From Beijing's perspective, the Hong Kong legislature is obliged to pass laws that will ascertain the larger political will that the Party represents, but for the residents in Hong Kong, such laws infringe their civil rights  and  violate the  SAR's  rights  to  make  its  own  legal  decisions.  In  the  eyes  of  many  Hong\\n\\nKongers, while Hong Kong is posited within the sovereign authority of the Chinese government, there is an extra juridical dimension in excess of the state power, instantiated in Hong Kong as a terrain free of any sovereign intervention.\\n\\nThis concept of extraterritoriality was developed out of a pluralistic juridical history. In Europe, the  idea  of  extraterritoriality  emerged  between  the  fifteenth  and  sixteenth  centuries  and  became matured,  together  with  the  idea  of  the  nation  states,  around  the  seventeenth  century.  At  first,  the Catholic Church defined Africa and the Americas as extraterritorial spaces, i.e. terra /land that lay beyond European jurisdiction and therefore could be freely acquired as colonies (Schmitt  2006 [1950]: 215-17). By the eighteenth century, the 'Orient' was seen as exercising an unsystematic notion of law, which was considered incompatible with the European conception of legality, thus justifying the right of European subjects to bring their laws and exercise them outside the sovereign terrains  of  their  nation  states  (Cassel  2012:  39-62).  During  the  1820s  and  1830s,  Portuguese, British, and  American merchants accepted with reluctance that they were legally bound by the codes of the Qing Empire (1644-1911). Yet in 1844, the Treaty of Wanghia (Wangxia), signed between the Qing Empire and the United States in Macau, stipulated that American citizens were to enjoy extraterritorial privileges, a clause that was then copied and provided for in all subsequent treaties between China and other European nation states (Fan 2015: 38; Ruskola 2013: 128-42).\\n\\nBetween 1844 and 1895, the European and Chinese understandings of extraterritoriality were somewhat different (Cassel 2012: 15-38). The Qing Empire was not a nation state as defined in  Euro-American  terms;  it  was  an  empire  governed  and  administered  with  a  linguistically, ethnically, culturally, and legally pluralistic system. The Qing code was a mixture of fazhi /rule by the law of the land and renzhi/judgment in accordance with the law of the political community to which a person belonged, and hence subjects had the right to be judged in accordance with the laws of their  respective  communities, which overrode the law of the  land where they  actually resided. In a legal case involving a dispute between subjects of two different ethnicities, a huishen /mixed court would be set up, presided by a Qing judge and accompanied by legal observers from the two respective communities. In this light, the Zongli Yamen/Foreign office at first understood extraterritoriality as a huishen quan/right of being judged in a mixed court, not a colonial privilege (Cassel 2012: 63-84). In 1863, the Qing government even established the famous Shanghai Mixed Court, which dealt with legal processes between Chinese and Euro-American subjects. In the SinoJapanese  Friendship  and  Trade  Treaty  (1871),  the  Japanese  delegates  called  the  huishen  quan enjoyed  by  the  Qing  subjects  in  Japan  sagaihōgen  (pronounced  zhiwai  faquan  in  Mandarin), borrowed in  1895  by  the  Qing  officials  to  redefine  the  extraterritorial  clause  in  the  Treaty  of Shimonoseki as a colonial privilege (Cassel 2012: 85-114).\\n\\nDuring the Republican period (1911-49), both Hong Kong and the foreign concessions of Shanghai were referred to as extraterritorial spaces, areas where the Chinese law formed only one component  of  a  complex  and  often  internally  inconsistent  pluralistic  system.  Based  on  the historical plurality of this concept, I propose to repurpose this term critically and redefine it in two ways: (1) these zones are geographically and juridically extraterritorial, that is, they are parts of the  larger  Chinese  territory;  they  somehow  stand  outside,  but  are  potentially  subject  to,  direct sovereign intervention from China; (2) because of its geographical and juridical extraterritoriality, its cultural, linguistic, and political spheres can be understood as pluralistic formations where both Chinese  and  Euro-American  discourses  unsystematically,  inconsistently,  or  even  conflictingly compete and negotiate with each other. The latter definition resonates with Shih Shu-mei's (2001: 34-35) definition of semicolonialism: a form of colonial consciousness based on unsystematic, mutually conflicting, and highly fragmented notions of Euro-American ideas and values that were reinvented and reconfigured through a complex discourse of translations.\\n\\nThe lack of direct sovereign intervention created an illusion, among those people who live in these zones, that their sense of cosmopolitanism, social mobility, political freedom, economic pleasure, and cultural fluidity are the results of such an extraterritorial privilege. However, I do not wish to reduce such political consciousness as a colonial privilege; rather, its affect, through Hong Kong's colonial experience, has been deeply ingrained in the Mainland-Hong Kong relationship under its specific historical conditions. In this sense, extraterritoriality, a colonial privilege that undercut Chinese sovereignty, has produced a sense of social, cultural, economic and political difference among  the  colonised  and  postcolonial  subjects.  As  Ackbar  Abbas  (2002  [1997]:  6-8)  argues, colonialism  in  Hong  Kong  was  characterised  by  a  'strange  dialectic  between  autonomy  and dependency that we see in Hong Kong's relation both to Britain and China' through a process of mutual misrecognition. As I argued in an article about the extraterritorial consciousness of  the Hong Kong Mandarin musical produced between 1945 and 1949 (Fan 2015: 39):\\n\\nas a Hong Konger, when I am being asked 'Are you Chinese?', I always feel compelled to answer  'No,  I'm  a  Hong  Konger.'  But  when  I  am  asked  the  reverse  'Are  you  a  Hong Konger?', I always find myself denying it by saying 'No, I am Chinese.' Thomas Elsaesser (2009: 47-62) calls this process 'double occupancy', that I am constantly doubly occupied by two mutually conflicting identities. Each time I choose one identity over the other, I am actively  putting  the  other  identity  'under  erasure',  i.e.  I  make  visible  the  structural difference and process of contestation between these two identities (Derrida 1976).\\n\\nSuch a difference is instantiated as an internally conflicting belief that one stands both inside and outside a larger national imagination and political consciousness. Ironically, the more eagerly the state  wishes  to  suture this  imaginary  gap,  the  more  adamantly  Hong  Kongers  feel  the  need  to redefine this  boundary as an attempt to reindividuate themselves from the Other. In this sense, extraterritoriality, despite its colonial history, has also been mobilised by Hong Kongers as a means of sociopolitical resistance.\\n\\n\\n## FROM CEPA TO EXTRATERRITORIAL CINEMA\\n\\n\\nIn cinema, through a series of legislations between 1998 and 2003, Hong Kong was reconfigured as an extraterritorial zone that occupies the threshold between the inside and outside of Chinese cinema. CEPA, signed in 2003, defines a Hong Kong production as a foreign-produced Chineselanguage film made by a Hong-Kong registered company that owns 75 per cent of its copyright. Yet if the company submits the screenplay to the China Film Bureau and passes its pre-censorship, it will be a granted domestic status and be distributed freely in the Mainland movie theatres. Once a Hong Kong production acquires its domestic status, it can persuade Mainland investors to finance the film. In 2006, of the 51 commercially released features produced in Hong Kong, 29 (56.86 per cent) of them were granted domestic status (Yang 2012: 20-21). In this sense, big-budget Hong Kong films financed by Mainland companies are best understood as extraterritorial productions that submit themselves to Mainland's legal regulation or a Mainland production that enjoys certain extraterritorial privileges.\\n\\nAccording to Lie Fu (2006: 615-18), Yang (2012: 46-51), and Zhao (2008: 216-19), CEPA was initially designed as a step towards national integration. Yet the China Film Bureau and the Mainland production companies soon realised that the spectators in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing - the three major film markets - carry different qinggan  affectivities. Yang (2012: 51-/ 56) argues that the Film Bureau and the production companies encourage projects that can help\\n\\nachieve  yishi  fenghe  /ideological  suture.  What  it means  is  that  a  commercially  successful  film should reconnect the two mutually  incoherent ideological  formations together,  by suturing the subjectival inconsistencies not between the Hong Kong and Mainland audiences, but within the political  subjectivities  of  the  Hong  Kong  spectators  and  the  Mainland  spectators  respectively. Yang (2012: 56-57) argues that postsocialist Mainland Chinese subjectivity and postcolonial Hong Kong subjectivity are both characterised by their respective modes of schizophrenia. The former is split into a continuous belief in and resistance against classical socialism on the one hand, and state-directed capitalism on the other. The latter is split into a growing acceptance of and resistance against Hong Kong's position in the larger national imagination.\\n\\nFor  instance,  based  on  the  negative  reception  of  the  2009  Hong  Kong-Mainland  coproduction Shiyue  weicheng (Ct. Sapjyut  waising Bodyguards  and  Assassins / (Chan,  2009)  in Mainland China, a  film about a number of unknown working-class Hong  Kong  martial artists sacrificing  their  lives  in  order to  protect  Sun  Yat-sen  (1866-1925)  from  being  assassinated  by killers sent by the Qing (1644-1911) government, Yang observes that while the Hong Kong critics praised the film for its successful negotiation between its local Hong Kong sensibility and its role in the larger national history, the Mainland viewers found the film incapable of addressing their ideological split:\\n\\nAs viewing subjects, these young [Mainland] spectators [of Bodyguards and Assassins ] were in a state of schizophrenia. On the one hand, in the film's attempt to educate [the Mainland viewers classical socialist beliefs], its vacuous modality of consciousness [ideology] was seen as overtly didactic […] The rhetoric of the film fails to communicate a message without preaching it. As a result, these young viewers find [the film] untrustworthy or even disgusting. In other words, [the film's]  classical  socialist  rhetoric  and  the  [Mainland]  spectators'  'real'  sensations  or  daily experience [under state-directed capitalism] constitute a severed or contradictory condition. Such a schizophrenic subjectival condition is precisely the very subjectival position constructed at the cusp  between  the  1970s and  the  1980s;  it  is  a  form  of  inconsistency  within  the  subjectivity  of postsocialist China. (Yang 2012: 56-57).\\n\\nYang (2012: 54) cites the film Tou ming zhuang (Ct. Tau ming zong )/ The Warlords (Chan, 2007), as a failed attempt to satisfy the ideal of ideological suture. As she points out, The Warlords was exceptionally well received in Hong Kong. The film represents a story about the rise and fall of three  sworn  brothers  as  warlords  who  help  the  Qing  government  to  fight  against  the  Taiping Rebellion (1850-64); after their success, these brothers, in their respective ways, hope to retain their regional influence despite the Qing court's effort to limit their power. In so doing, the film promotes a form of multi-focal and pluralistic form of government alternative to the centralized system of the PRC. Likewise, John Woo's Chibi (Ct. Cekbik ) / Red Cliff (2008-09) is structured around the preservation of the three kingdoms as divided yet codependent political entities. Before the final battle, the character Zhu Geliang (Kaneshiro Takeshi) whispers to himself:  tianxia san fen, zhi zai tianyi/I entrust my hope to maintain our tripartite political divide to the will of heaven. His wish can be read as a metaphor of the tripartite relationship between the Mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong director and audience's desire to maintain such a status quo with minimum Mainland intervention. In other words, these works are more interested in healing the subjectival conflict sensed and perceived by the Hong Kong viewers, than in renegotiating the subjectival inconsistencies of their Mainland counterparts.\\n\\nWhat is at stake in these films that are believed to have failed to suture the ideological divide  between  the  Mainland  and  Hong  Kong,  and  within  their  respective  schizophrenic\\n\\nsubjectivities is their instance on the idea of making palpable a sense of extraterritorial affectivity. By engaging the spectators in scenarios where heroes and warriors - often played by top-billing movie stars - fight for regional autonomy or alternative modes of political governance, these films validate the idea of national integrity and unity as an underlying political assumption, yet suggest that centralized governance may not be the best option for those who enjoy the political and economic privileges with their extraterritorial status.\\n\\n\\n## Drug War\\n\\n\\nThe  underlying  assumption  of  Yuan  Yanying's  argument,  and  the  political  intention  of  many coproductions made after CEPA, is that political schizophrenia requires suturing by reconstructing a unified political subjectivity. As William Brown argues, in Lacanian terms, ideological suture is less about the reconciliation of two seemingly incompatible ideological structures within one's subjectivity, than the 'sewing' of one's conflicting affects and sensibilities to a totalising imaginary Other. 2 Drug War, I  propose, opens  a  new  path  by  putting  the  spectators  in  a  position  where  all  attempts  to reconfigure a unified political subjectivity have already failed. As Elsaesser (2012: 225-36; Fan 2008: 454) argues, the failure to perform is also a performance of failure. He takes this clue from Freud's concept Fehlleistung/ parapraxis,  more  popularly  known  as  the  Freudian  slip.  When  one  fails  to perform a task or utterance, one indeed performs one's failure to perform such a task or utterance as a process of reconfiguring a traumatic memory that one has failed to acknowledge. For example, if I promise my guest a cup of tea, and I bring him whiskey instead, I failed to bring my promise to fruition. But  my  failure  to  do  so  performs  my  failure  to  acknowledge  a  personal  trauma  that  I  may  have repressed all along (e.g. I have always wished to have whiskey with my father since my childhood, but he always insisted that I have tea instead). In the context of Hong Kong's extraterritoriality, the failure to configure a unified political subjectivity performs the failure by the Beijing government to graft the concept of national identity onto the political subjectivity of Hong Kongers and to acknowledge Hong Kong's double occupancy and extraterritorial consciousness, and the failure of any attempt to construct a unified political subjectivity in the first place.\\n\\nThe narrative structure of Drug War is organised around two imaginary differences: law and lawlessness, humanity and animality. In the film, Hong Kong drug trafficker Timmy Choi (Louis Koo) is arrested by Mainland police officer Zhang Lei (Zhang Honglei), and Timmy decides to cooperate with the police in hopes of reducing his sentence. In the end, however, Timmy not only fights against the  Mainland  police,  but  also  kills  his  Hong  Kong  and  Mainland  compatriots.  Through  the collaboration  and  contestation  between  Timmy  and  Zhang  Lei,  the  narrative  offers  an  imaginary discourse and resolution to the real tension between Hong Kong and Mainland along the dual axes of legality and humanity.\\n\\nUnlike many post-CEPA films in which the protagonist mediates and reconciles the subjectival difference between the Hong Kong and Mainland viewers by making a moral decision that can bring these two imaginary poles to a meeting point, Timmy in Drug War is unfettered by any standard of morality  and  identity.  Being  a  character  from  Hong  Kong  and  the  one  who  consistently  speaks Cantonese (in the Hong Kong version), Timmy can be easily identified as a representative of Hong Kong. Yet the film does not clarify his identity in the beginning. Instead, Timmy is shown in the first fifteen minutes of the film as an animal body that has no subjectival coordination, sense of unity, and complete control over his sensorimotor system. The film begins with a long shot of a (meth) factory located in a rural area in the background of the frame. Yellow smoke rises from the factory, suggesting  that  an  explosion  has  occurred.  A  car  emerges  from  the  background,  and  runs diagonally from the background (right of frame) to the foreground (left of frame). . The film then cuts to a medium closeup of a man (Timmy) steering the car recklessly, and looking like he is about to vomit (intoxicated by the fumes from the explosion). This is followed by a long shot of\\n\\nthe car swirling down a road, away from the camera, and then by a reverse shot of the car on a different road. The film then cuts back to a medium close-up of Timmy, in which he vomits outside the window. A 'medium shot' of the car then follows, where it makes a sharp turn around a street corner, and the camera pans right as the car is driven down the road. After that, the film shows a low-angle long shot of a series of surveillance cameras, from the perspective of a moving car, followed by a repetition of Timmy's medium closeup, where Timmy begins to lose control of the steering wheel.\\n\\nThen, the film cuts to a high-angle long shot of a city street, where Timmy's car is driven across different lanes. The viewers then see a close-up of Timmy's arm and hear the ring tone of a mobile phone; as Timmy raises his arm, the phone is revealed, and the camera zooms into it a little. This is followed by a long shot of the car approaching a busy intersection, with the camera panning to the left and craning up to reveal a wider view of the street. The film then cuts to a highangle long shot of the car turning around the intersection towards the front door of a restaurant, followed by a low angle long shot of the vestibule area inside the restaurant, and then a straight on angle long shot of this area from the interior of the restaurant, as the car crashes through the door into the reception area.\\n\\nThis  fast-paced  montage  sequence  introduces  Timmy  as  an  irrational,  intoxicated,  and reckless being who is entirely governed by an animal instinct to survive without necessarily having any specific desire or want. The sequence begins with Timmy coming out of the meth factory (death), and  ends  with  his  car  smashing  into  the  restaurant  (rushing  to  death).  While  Timmy's  sense  of disorientation is instilled into the viewers' sensoria by means of its fast-paced editing, subtle and quick camera movements, and rapid alternation between long shots and close ups. Meanwhile, his animalistic determination to survive is emphasised by the spectators' overall sense that Timmy is driving his car to a certain destination, albeit the destination is his potential death. Yet embedded in this sequence is a long shot of a series of surveillance cameras. Although these cameras are seen from the perspective of a moving car, the shot itself is never sutured to a shot of Timmy looking, thus creating an effect that these cameras are actively looking back at the audience. In a similar manner, even though the phone call may have come from a friend of Timmy's, the mobile phone itself serves (as the film will later confirm) as a GPS device under the state's surveillance system. In short, the animality and lawlessness of Timmy is, from the beginning moment of this film, actively tracked, surveyed, and regulated by the law and the mode of humanity the law claims to protect and maintain.\\n\\nLater, after Timmy has woken up in his hospital bed, he is shown as a trapped animal that is alerted by his corporeal instinct to escape, but again without a specific destination or objective. In these two sequences, Timmy is therefore shown neither as a human being who can think, nor as a rational being who actively pursues a desire. Rather, every movement and decision he makes is simply driven by a physiological instinct to survive - first without any control of his body (in the car), and then with his body taking complete control over his cognitive functions (in the hospital). In Lacanian terms, Timmy can be understood as a drive creature, i.e. a creature that is already dead, driven not by any lack and governed not by any law (of the father or of the land), but as an embodiment of all those ethical values, pleasures, and displeasures that are precisely unsanctioned by the law. Yet the gaze of the Other constantly puts him under surveillance, restrains him, and pursues him.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nThe dual axes between law and lawlessness, humanity and animality are further reiterated in  the  interrogation  scene,  where  they  are  clearly  mapped  onto  the  dichotomized  relationship between Hong Kong and the Mainland. During the initial interrogation, Timmy sits behind bars as though he were a caged animal. Officer Yang Xiaobei (Huang Yi) reads out Timmy's bio, and strategically  pauses  at  a  point  when  she  announces  that  he  is  a  Hong  Konger.  Here,  the  film deliberately cuts to a shot-reverse-shot, with a door slamming at the interval between the first two shots that haunts the soundtrack: (1) Xiaobei announces Timmy's identity over Timmy's close-up as the camera dollies in, followed by the sound of a metallic door slamming at the cut (see Figure 1); here, Timmy stares directly at the camera; (2) a three-quarter shot of Xiaobei and Zhang Lei, shot behind Timmy's shoulders - Xiaobei and Zhang Lei raise their eyes towards Timmy (see Figure 2); (3) a reverse shot of Timmy (three-quarter) looking at Xiaobei (see Figure 3).\\n\\nThis shot-reverse-shot structure sets up a peculiar tension between Timmy and the two Mainland police officers, where the accuser and the accused are intricately reversible. The key of this shot-reverse-shot structure is the first image, in which Timmy looks directly into the camera lens while hearing Xiaobei's announcement of his identity. This shot, together with the sound of the door slam, has the effect of turning Xiaobei's announcement into a legal accusation, as though being  a  Hong  Konger  is  the  criminal  charge  itself.  The  second  over-the-shoulder  shot  from Timmy's point of view accentuates Xiaobei's accusative gaze, which has the effect of turning what she said into a speech-act that instantiates her authority, one that subsumes Timmy under the law of  the  land,  but  at  the  same  time,  ostracizes  him  from  the  interior  of  the  imaginary  polis  (the Mainland). Curiously, such a speech act is conferred upon a creature that is 'already dead' under the gaze of the law, who is interrogated, with his presumed guilt, behind bars as though he had already  been  stripped  of  his  subjectivity,  citizenship  and  humanity.  Nevertheless,  the  first  two shots align the camera's gaze with Timmy's, which invite the spectators to identify with him and 'look back' at his accuser. Eventually, in the third over-the-shoulder shot, the spectators' eyes are drawn to Timmy's equally accusative gaze towards Xiaobei, thus making the power relationship between the accuser and the accused reversible. 3\\n\\nAs an  outlaw  and  a  figure  that  has  no  sense  of  morality,  Timmy  is  posited  from  the  very beginning of the film as what Giorgio Agamben (1998 [1995]: 1-2) would call a homo sacer. Agamben defines the homo sacer as a bare life that is neither human nor animal, and is ostracised by a political community as someone who can be executed without breaking the law. But by the same token, he is also there to manage, manipulate, and execute life at the liminal space between law and lawlessness. For Agamben, both the socially ostracised, and curiously, the sovereign, occupy this liminal position between life and death, human and animal. The former can be executed by the law, as it occupies this zone of exception from the law and humanity, whereas the latter makes law from a position where it is not answerable to any law. In this light, Zhang Lei and Timmy are both homines sacri: while Zhang Lei stands outside the law in order to instantiate Chinese sovereignty, Timmy, as a Hong Konger, is a priori ostracised by the Chinese sovereign authority in order to be managed, disciplined, and eventually, executed. Once understood as two homines sacri, Zhang Lei and Timmy are no longer standing on the two opposite sides of the dual axes between law and lawlessness, humanity and animality. Instead, they both occupy the positions of lawlessness and animality, and sovereignty is instantiated precisely by their mutual negotiation, collaboration, and reconfiguration.\\n\\nIf  one  reads  Timmy  as  a homo  sacer, the  film  neither  tries  to  humanise  him  nor  further animalise him; rather, it works through the various means by which a homo sacer can make use of his liminal space between law and lawlessness, humanity and animality to survive as abject. For example, Timmy's juridical liminality and dehumanised status allow him to manipulate his information in order to try getting himself out of his impasse, often without any scruples. Yet over and over again, Timmy ends up drawing himself into deeper and deeper trouble with the Mainland authority, which constantly tries to rein him in by breaking its own law (Fan 2014: 29). For example, in the first collaborative mission between Timmy and Zhang Lei, Zhang Lei masquerades himself as a midlevel drug trafficker Ha Ha, and is introduced by Timmy to a higher-level trafficker Chang. During their meeting, Chang offers Zhang Lei pure-grade cocaine, which Zhang Lei cannot refuse without exposing his identity as a  police  officer.  After  the  meeting,  Zhang  Lei's  body  reacts  violently  to  the  drug,  and  Timmy  is immediately handcuffed, pushed to the ground in an undignified squatting position. Despite all this, Timmy cries out instructions to teach the other police officers to help Zhang Lei cool down his body. After Zhang Lei has finally recovered, he walks up to Timmy and squats down in front of him. Instead of thanking Timmy, Zhang Lei accuses Timmy of sending a signal to Chang during their meeting. Upset by this accusation, Timmy gives Zhang Lei an angry tirade. After this, Zhang Lei calms down and orders his team to go to Erzhou, and the film cuts to a high angle close up of Timmy and Zhang\\n\\nLei facing each other in a graphically symmetrical composition (figure 4), thus suggesting that the two are in fact occupying the same liminal position between law and lawlessness, humanity and animality.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nFor many spectators, in the film, there is one scene in which Timmy does seem to show some compassion, and therefore, hints of humanity. When Timmy, under arrest, returns to the warehouse where he adheres surveillance microphones and cameras around the facility, he is invited by his staff, a family of mutes, for dinner, and they thank Timmy for taking care of them. At dinner, Timmy pauses and cries, and he gesticulates to the family that his wife was killed in the explosion earlier that morning. Timmy then performs the rite of wine offering at the table. He then burns real money as sacrificial offering. In this scene, Timmy seems to show a hint of compassion for his wife, and Zhang Lei and his team also seem to be touched by Timmy's sense of Confucian lunchang   human order and relationship. / Yet what undermines Timmy's humanity is that he performs these rituals with full knowledge that he is being watched, thus rendering his action as a pure performance under surveillance. In addition, by burning real money, the offering is less intended for his wife, but for the still-living, i.e. for a drive creature like Timmy, who is already at the liminal space between life and death, and is simply waiting for the moment of his physical execution by the law.\\n\\nIn the final face-off between Timmy, the Mainland police, and the Hong Kong triad members, Timmy  manages  to  kill  everyone,  only  to  find  himself  fettered  by  the  law,  as  Zhang  Lei  cuffed Timmy's leg immediately before he died (figure 21). In one register, this denouement can be read as Timmy being reined in by the law of the land, but in another register, this image reinforces the idea that both Timmy and Zhang Lei are homines sacri who work together to instantiate sovereign authority. Johnnie To chooses to end the film with the sight of Timmy getting executed. The sight of his dying body,  I  argue,  serves  to  offer  a  critique  of  the  state  power.  This  image  opens  up  the  imaginary incommensurability between the Mainland and Hong Kong legal systems and values of life: in the former system, the death sentence has to be carried out, whereas in the latter, following the British protocol, it is automatically condoned by the Chief Executive. In the image, a Hong Konger, who is supposed to enjoy some level of extraterritorial privilege, is executed as a bare life under the state power of the PRC, thus criticising the biopolitical power of the Central Government -- that is, as Michel Foucault (2002 [1976]: 178) argues, 'to take life or let live.'\\n\\n\\n## CONCLUSION\\n\\n\\nDrug War offers a peculiar new model of film narrative for post-CEPA Hong Kong cinema. In one register, the film seems to try reining in the extraterritorial mentality and sensibility of the Hong Kong spectators by subsuming, and eventually, executing, a Hong Konger under the national criminal law (Fan 2014: 29-30). In another register, however, by inviting the viewers to identify and share the fear and anxiety with a protagonist who is effectively reduced as a homo sacer, the  film rehearses and reperforms the audience's sense of  failure, that  is, the  failure  to  claim  any  political  subjectivity  or\\n\\nafford any  sociopolitical morality and humanity  under  the  biopolitical power  of  the state. Extraterritoriality, in this sense, is no longer considered a postcolonial privilege or sense of superiority; rather,  it  is  both  a  legacy  of  colonial  biopolitics  and  a  gradual  erosion  of  concepts  of  political subjectivity and citizenship under the SAR government. But by the same token, the only way one can survive as a Hong Konger is, ironically, to retain this extraterritorial status as the basis of reconfiguring its sense of political community and ontological consistency. But perhaps more disturbingly, the film illustrates that extraterritoriality itself is in fact a myth. It is because this  liminal space between law and lawlessness, humanity and animality is deliberately set up, under state surveillance, in order that sovereign authority can be instantiated not as the law of the land, but as a land where the law can be freely reconfigured, reinterpreted, reinstated, annulled or dissolved as a means to manage, discipline, educate,  and  execute  those homines  sacri that  occupy  this  space.  Hong  Kong  is  therefore  best understood as a place that is doubly occupied of two modes of extraterritoriality: the version sanctioned by the state in order to manage and discipline, and the version promoted by those residents who resist any form of ideological suture. Hong Kong is, after all, always already occupied and always doubly occupied.\\n\\n\""

       "'## 1. Introduction\\n\\n\\nAn Electronic Health Record (EHR) System is the digitized version of a patient\\'s medical chart record  containing  medical  history,  diagnoses,  treatment  plans,  immunization  records,  and  test  results. 1 EHRs reduce diagnostic errors and patient safety concerns (Graber et al. 2017, Hydari et al. 2019). EHRs also improve coordination and integration of care by providing real-time data at the point of care, efficient transfer of information across settings, and physician decision-support (Rathert et al. 2019). As of 2021, 89% of office-based physicians in the US had adopted an EHR system (Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology 2021). In a 2018 survey of 500 primary care physicians in the US, 63% of physicians agreed that EHRs had led to improved care. However, 71% of physicians also said EHRs significantly contribute to physician burnout (Stanford Medicine 2018).\\n\\nSinsky et al. (2016) found that outpatient clinicians spend two hours on EHR and desk work for every hour spent on direct clinical face time. Several recent studies have associated physician time spent on EHR systems with lower patient satisfaction (Marmor 2018), and for physicians, more work-after-work hours (Attipoe 2021), attrition (Melnick et al. 2021), and burnout (Arndt et al. 2017). In an article in The New  Yorker on  physician  EHR  workload,  Dr.  Atul  Gawande  states,  \" Something\\'s  gone  terribly wrong. Doctors are among the most technology-avid people in society; computerization has simplified tasks in many industries. Yet somehow, we\\'ve reached a point where people in the medical profession actively, viscerally, volubly hate their computers.\" (Gawande 2018). In a 2019 statement, the American Medical Association called an overhaul of the design and use of EHR systems a \"national imperative\" due to the high correlation between EHR use and physician burnout (American Medical Association 2019).\\n\\nAlthough numerous studies have identified the detrimental impact of physician EHR workload, a key question remains - is it possible to reduce EHR workload through better operational practices, such as structuring the EHR work differently? Interviews conducted by Zhang (2016) and Attiope (2021) show that physicians take varying approaches to manage their EHR work before or after appointments, while in the examination room with the patient (multitasking), and finally, after the end of the workday. Figure 1 shows the same categories in our dataset, and we see large differences across physicians. In this paper, we seek to exploit the heterogeneity in physician actions across appointments to study how these differences impact total time spent using EHR and time spent after-work hours on EHR.\\n\\nIn particular, we investigate the trade-offs of working on EHR tasks in different idle times between appointments (i.e., before and after appointments). The time between appointments represents the idle time from the primary task (seeing a patient) but are times when secondary tasks may be completed. Doing EHR work before an appointment may help physicians conduct early task initiation (Batt and Terwiesch 2017), prepare for tasks during the appointment (Verbruggen et al. 2007, Altmann 2004), and efficiently capture key EHR details due to this effort. Alternatively, by doing work beforehand, it may take longer as task switching occurs (Staats and Gino 2012, KC, 2014, Gurvich et al., 2020), and the work may fill to expand the time available (Parkinson 1955, Hasija et al. 2010). When work is completed after an appointment, it may be more efficient as all (or most) information is available, and there is better recall after an appointment (KC 2014). However, it is also possible that time increases due to lower productivity from longer work hours (Caruso 2014) and task interruptions (Froehle and White 2014).\\n\\nWe focus on EHR tasks performed during idle time as the idle time between appointments is a decision variable for hospital management during appointment scheduling. So, idle time can potentially be used to influence physicians\\' practices around EHR usage. Additionally, the trade-offs associated with doing EHR tasks in idle time between appointments have been discussed qualitatively in prior studies (Zhang  et  al.  2016,  Attiope  2021).  In  these  surveys,  physicians  have  expressed  various  opinions  and\\n\\nintuitive  reasons  for  performing  EHR  in  different  time  intervals,  and  we  want  to  study  idle  time quantitatively.\\n\\nThis  topic  is  critical  to  improving  healthcare  operations,  but  it  is  also  part  of  a  more  general discussion on how work should be done (Narayanan et al. 2009, KC et al. 2020, Pendem et al. 2022). Although much emphasis is placed on the primary tasks to be completed, such as patient treatment or surgery (Bartel et al. 2020, Youn et al. 2022), assembling a car in a factory (Bernstein &amp; Kok 2009), or answering a call in a call center (Aksin et al. 2007), operations also include secondary tasks that support the primary work (Dai et al. 2015, Legros et al. 2020). These might consist of EHR use, hand hygiene (Dai et al. 2015) or lab tests in healthcare (Batt and Terwiesch 2017), supply positioning or tool preparation in manufacturing, or data entry in call centers. Secondary work is necessary to complete the primary work, and an open question is when (or, in some cases, if) it should be completed.\\n\\nIt  is  necessary  to  study  secondary  tasks  separately  as  service  operators  typically  have  greater discretion  on  when to  perform  them.  Secondly,  during  scheduling,  workload  due  to  secondary tasks is typically ignored,  even  though  these tasks are  often a  significant  burden  on  the  operator.  Lastly, these secondary tasks are usually performed outside of customer encounter time but may influence the workload and  outcome  of  the  service  experience.  Consequently,  it  may  be  possible  to  affect  performance  by identifying and implementing improved practices for managing secondary tasks.\\n\\nThis paper uses the critical context of EHR usage to shed light on this more general question. In particular, we focus on the following research questions:\\n\\n- 1. How does the total time spent on EHR depend on when the EHR tasks are performed?\\n- 2. How does an increase in idle time between appointments affect the timing of EHR work?\\n- Figure 1: Average EHR Use at Different Parts of the Day for Each Physician\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nThe first research question allows us to understand the operational impact of structuring secondary tasks. At least part of the answer addresses a classic question, is it better to prepare before or wait until after the primary task is completed to work on secondary tasks? The answer to the second research question\\n\\nprovides  insights  into  managing  appointment  schedules  to  influence  secondary  task  completion.  For balancing workload, prior studies have discussed trade-offs associated with early task initiation (Batt and Terwiesch 2017), multitasking (Tan and Netessine 2014), and task switching (Staats and Gino, Gurvich et al. 2019). However, the impact of structuring secondary tasks with scheduled appointments has not been studied.\\n\\nWe examine when EHR work should be completed using data from over 150,000 appointments across 74 physicians in the Family Medicine unit of a large Academic Medical Center in the US. Our dataset includes  detailed  information  on  appointments  and  physicians\\'  EHR  system  use,  including  activity  on individual patient records. This allows us to obtain time spent on EHR by a physician related to a particular patient. We perform our analysis at the appointment level as there is considerable heterogeneity in when EHR tasks are done even for the same physician. We focus our attention on two key outcome measures: total time spent on EHR systems and physicians\\' EHR time after regular work hours. We focus on these two measures for two reasons. First, total EHR workload and EHR time spent during after-work hours significantly contribute to physician burnout (Tran et al. 2019). Second, these two measures have been identified as important aspects of hospital operational performance (Sinsky et al. 2020).\\n\\nWe categorize when physicians complete the secondary task of EHR use. There are four times during a day when physicians might complete EHR work for an appointment: before the appointment (what we label prework), during the appointment (what we label multitasking), after the appointment, but before the end of the day (what we label postwork) or after the workday (what we label end-of-day work). Different trade-offs are associated with doing EHR tasks in each time period.\\n\\nOur paper demonstrates that work structure is important for EHR tasks, as when they are performed significantly impacts total and after-work EHR time. Specifically, we find prework is a dominant strategy because it can reduce total time spent on EHR and end-of-day EHR work, whereas postwork can reduce end-of-day EHR work but increase total time spent on EHR.\\n\\nWe estimate that performing an additional five minutes of prework (about a one standard deviation increase) reduces the sum of multitasking, postwork, and end-of-day EHR work by 6.9 minutes. In other words, a 5-minute increase in prework in an appointment leads to a net reduction in total EHR time of 1.9 minutes for that appointment, a decrease of 10.5%.  Approximately 0.9 minutes of this reduction is from the decrease in end-of-day EHR work, a decrease of 46%. In our setting, with 74 physicians who average 13 appointments per day, this translates into 31 fewer hours of total EHR work with 13 fewer hours in afterhour EHR work per day.\\n\\nIf  a  physician  spends  five  additional  minutes  on  postwork,  then  end-of-day  work  for  that appointment decreases by 1.4 minutes, a reduction of 72%. This translates to a total reduction of 21 hours in after-hour EHR work per day for our setting. However, the total EHR workload goes up by 3.6 minutes\\n\\nper appointment, or 58 hours per day, across all physicians in our setting. To summarize, our results indicate that  increasing  prework  helps  reduce  both  total  and  end-of-day  EHR  work.  Alternatively,  increasing postwork reduces end-of-day EHR hours but at the cost of increasing total EHR time.\\n\\nHospitals can encourage physicians to do more prework and postwork by increasing the idle time between appointments. We find that increases in idle time lead to significant increases in prework and postwork in our sample. The magnitude of the increase is significantly more for postwork than for prework. This suggests that during increases in idle times, physicians increase prework and postwork but focus more on postwork.\\n\\nOur solution approach and results contribute in the following principal ways. First, the appointment scheduling literature has typically focused on the trade-off between idle buffer time between appointments, patient delays, and physician makespan when scheduling customer encounters. Appointment scheduling literature  typically  defines  makespan  as  the  sum  of  idle  time  and  appointment  time.  According  to  this definition,  increasing  idle  time  between  appointments  reduces  patient  delay  at  the  cost  of  increasing physician makespan (Robinson and Chen 2003). However, if we incorporate time spent on secondary tasks, makespan would need to be defined as the sum of idle time, appointment time, and end-of-day time spent on secondary tasks. In the presence of secondary tasks, physicians can perform these tasks during the idle time  between appointments,  leading to  less  end-of-day  work  and  a  lower  makespan.  Therefore,  in  the presence of secondary tasks, increasing idle time may not always have a detrimental effect on makespan.\\n\\nSecond, we contribute to the literature on task selection and sequencing. We find that performing some secondary tasks before the primary task can be a dominant strategy leading to less time spent on secondary  work  and  less  time  spent  on  secondary  work  after  the  end  of  the  workday.  These  benefits potentially accrue due to task preparation and early-task initiation (Batt and Terwiesch 2017) by reducing the load from busier parts of the workday. We also find that performing secondary tasks after the primary task helps reduce work at the end of the workday but would increase the total time spent on secondary tasks due to increased interruptions. Prior findings in the literature related to task sequencing have not typically focused on the relative value of doing pre-appointment and post-appointment secondary tasks.\\n\\nFinally, our managerial insights help schedulers create appointment schedules that reduce burnout due to EHR workload. These varying effects of prework and postwork suggest that when clinicians create protected time for EHR tasks, the recommended use of that time would depend on the clinic\\'s objective. If the objective is to reduce the total EHR workload, greater emphasis can be placed on doing prework. If the objective is to reduce after-work EHR time, then increasing postwork would give a greater marginal benefit, although at the cost of increasing total EHR time.\\n\\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the related literature. Section 3 describes a  physician\\'s  appointment  and  EHR  activities  in  detail  and  motivates  our  study\\'s  relevant  hypotheses.\\n\\nSection 4 describes the data, the empirical strategy, and the results. In Section 5, we discuss the model and our empirical strategy. In Section 6, we present our findings and discuss possible alternative explanations. Finally, in Section 7, we discuss the implications of our findings and end with concluding remarks.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Literature Review\\n\\n\\nOur paper is related to four streams of literature. The first stream of literature is research on the impact of technology on healthcare professionals\\' workload and productivity. Introducing technology in healthcare delivery has many advantages, such as improving patient access through additional delivery channels  and  improved  physician  decision  support.  However,  recent  studies  have  found  that  these technologies\\' operational impact may sometimes be negative.\\n\\nTechnology-enabled channels of healthcare delivery, such as e-visits and telemedicine, increase physician workload (Bavafa et al. 2018, Bavafa and Terwiesch 2019), increase costs (Çakıcı and Mills 2021), and may worsen patient health disparities (Sunar and Staats 2022). Adopting IT technologies may also create legal vulnerabilities for physicians through increased information visibility (Kim et al. 2021) and may lead to lower physician productivity (Bhargava and Mishra 2014). Recent studies on EHR usage in  clinical services literature  have found an association between increasing EHR usage with increasing burnout and turnover (Sinsky et al. 2016, Melnick 2021) and lower patient satisfaction (Marmor et al. 2018). Lee  et  al.  (2021)  consider  EHR  documentation  work  from  a  queuing  modeling  perspective.  They computationally evaluate different workflow policies for managing EHR work. They conduct a numerical evaluation of these workflow management policies\\' impact on patient wait time and physician overtime. We contribute to this literature by investigating the effect of structuring EHR work in the idle time between appointments on the total and after-hours EHR workload.\\n\\nThe second research stream related to our work is multitasking. Empirical studies on multitasking analyze servers simultaneously handling multiple customers or various task types (Narayanan et al. 2009, Staats and Gino 2012, Tan and Netessine 2014, KC 2014, Freeman et al. 2017, Berry Jaeker et al. 2017, Gurvich et al. 2020). Gurvich et al. (2020) is a closely related paper to our context. They quantify the changeover  time  when  the  physicians  switch  between  documentation  and  collaboration  with  other physicians. Patient interactions are not scheduled and are at the physician\\'s discretion in their setting. A key distinguishing feature in our paper is that physicians alternate between scheduled face-to-face time with patients and documentation tasks. Progression of scheduled appointments creates idle time during the day, and we focus on physicians\\' use of this idle time towards EHR tasks.\\n\\nA related set of papers on multitasking are queuing models with one server or group of servers balancing two work queues (Gans and Zhou 2003, Legros et al. 2020). Legros et al. (2020) discuss service operators\\' switching between customer interaction and back-office tasks. They derive optimal threshold policies  for  using  the  interlude  time  between  customer  interactions.  Further,  they  show  that  with  task-\\n\\nswitching costs and multiple interludes, back-office work should be concentrated on fewer, more extended, and later interludes. There are two primary differences in our context. First, in our context, physicians can also  perform  documentation  work  during  the  appointment  in  addition  to  the  time  between  customer encounters which is not the case for tasks in Legros et al. (2020). Second, with EHR documentation work, as we observe from our results, not all work done in the interludes between appointments may have the same effect. We find that pre-appointment and post-appointment EHR work affect the total EHR workload differently.\\n\\nThe third stream of literature is related to the operational impact of task selection and sequencing by service workers. The sequencing of tasks can be driven by a motivation to shift work upstream, as in Batt and Terwiesch (2017). They find that early initiation of lab tests during the triage process in Emergency Departments (EDs) reduces treatment time but may increase the total number of tests performed. Another motivation for task selection could be a preference to complete tasks. KC et al. (2020) find that a preference to complete easy tasks is related to lower throughput and learning in an ED. Ibanez et al. (2018) find that in addition to preferring to do easier tasks first, physicians also prefer to batch similar tasks together. They find this preference for easier and similar tasks negatively impacts productivity. In a related study, Feizi et al. (2022) found that ED physicians\\' preference for batching admissions leads to longer patient wait times. The preference to do easier tasks may be driven by task familiarity, as Niewoehner et al. (2022) find with physicians\\'  selection  of  patients  in  an  ED.  They  find  that  greater  familiarity  with  patients  increases physicians\\' patient pick-up rate, leading to shorter wait times with no negative impact on processing time or  length  of  stay.  We  contribute  to  this  stream  of  work  by  studying  how  physicians  use  the  interludes between appointments to complete secondary tasks such as EHR-related tasks.\\n\\nThe  fourth  stream  of  literature  related  to  our  work  is  appointment  scheduling.  Healthcare appointment scheduling has a long line of research (Gupta and Denton 2008, Ahmadi-Javid et al. 2017). The  principal  problem  in  scheduling  is  allocating  time  for  each  appointment  of  the  day  to  optimize performance measures such as idle time, physician overtime, and patient wait times. Recent literature in this field has incorporated factors such as no-shows, cancellations (Liu et al. 2010, Kong et al. 2020), walkin customers (Chen and Robinson 2014, Wang et al. 2019), patient preferences (Feldman et al., 2014), and multi-priority  patients  (Sauré  et  al.  2020).  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  recent  literature  has  not incorporated the impact of doing secondary tasks such as documentation work between appointments. In scheduling literature,  idle  time  between  appointments  has  a  detrimental  effect  on  physician  makespan. However,  when  EHR  workload  is  considered,  increased  idle  time  can  reduce  physician  makespan  by reducing  after-work  hours  doing  documentation  tasks.  Our  empirical  investigation  on  the  impact  of physicians utilizing the idle time between appointments for documentation work will help guide future research on appointment scheduling.\\n\\n\\n## 3. Process Description and Hypothesis Development\\n\\n\\n\\n## 3.1 Process Description\\n\\n\\nDetailed descriptions of physician actions related to a visit are available in Dobson et al. (2009), Wetterneck et al. (2012), and Holman et al. (2016). We summarize the salient points below.\\n\\nPatients typically book appointments a few days to a few months in advance. On the day of the appointment, the front desk staff collects basic information such as age and insurance information after the patient\\'s  arrival.  Patients  who  fail  to  attend  an  appointment  without  prior  notice  are  called  no-shows. Literature estimates the prevalence of no-shows between 7-26% for Academic Medical Centers in the US (Dantas et al. 2018).\\n\\nAt the scheduled start time, when an examination room becomes available, the nurse receives and accompanies the patient to the room, where they perform a preliminary physical examination, including measuring  weight  and  blood  pressure.  Following  this,  the  physician,  after  they  have  concluded  their previous visit, enters the examination room. After entering the room, the physician performs the following principal tasks: gathers patient information through discussion and questions, reviews patient information by  reading  from  the  EHR,  documents  patient  information  in  the  EHR  system,  performs  a  physical examination of the patient, looks up treatment and drug information, recommends treatment options after discussion  with  the  patient,  orders  medication  and  tests,  gives/communicates  to  patient  prescription, information, or instructions, and finally concludes the appointment, sometimes by walking the patient to another location in the clinic.\\n\\nAs Holman et al. (2016) note, physicians do not perform these activities consistently in the same sequence,  and  task  sequencing  demonstrates  significant  variation  depending  on  the  patient\\'s  clinical conditions, the progression of the visit, and physician characteristics. For example, the physician may cycle through activities such as gathering, reviewing, looking up information, and communicating with the patient multiple times  within the same  appointment.  Some EHR tasks,  such  as  reviewing  patient  information, interpreting laboratory reports, finding missing or pending information, arranging tests or consultations, and completing forms, may be done before the appointment (Gottschalk et al. 2005). Surveys (Attipoe 2021) indicate that physicians perform some EHR activities such as finishing their notes, closing outpatient charts, and following up on lab results and patients\\' responses or comments after the end of the workday. Gottschalk et al. (2005) estimate that physicians performed 14.5% of visit-specific activities either before or after the appointment.\\n\\n\\n## 3.2 Hypothesis Development\\n\\n\\nWe  develop  hypotheses  on  the  impact  of  performing  EHR  activity  in  idle  time  between appointments. We first consider the causal impact of prework on the total time spent on the EHR system.\\n\\nPrework  includes  reviewing  patient  demographic  information,  previous  laboratory  reports,  and  any previous communication from the patient or other caregivers (Wetterneck et al. 2012, Zhang et al. 2016).\\n\\nThere are three potential reasons prework may increase total EHR time. First, prework will increase task-switching from patient interactions to documentation. Switching time may increase physicians\\' EHR system time. Literature in operations management and psychology has identified the detrimental effects of task switching due to increased changeover time (Staats and Gino 2012, KC 2014, Gurvich et al. 2020). Second, idle time before an appointment may lead physicians to spend more time doing prework than usual, demonstrating Parkinson\\'s law, the adage that \"work expands to fill the time available for its completion\" (Parkinson 1955). Parkinson\\'s law has been studied in contexts such as project management (Gutierrez and Kouvelis 1991) and call centers (Hasija et al. 2010).\\n\\nLastly, some prework tasks may be unnecessary, and the physician may need to rework in the patient\\'s presence. Holman et al. (2016) give the following example of a patient encounter:\\n\\nThe PCP suggests a medication for one of the patient\\'s problems, and the patient recognizes that the  medication  was  tried  previously  and  affected  her  negatively.  The  PCP  again  searches  the patient\\'s EHR, reviewing the patient\\'s historical medications and laboratory values to confirm this and changes the patient\\'s treatment recommendation.\\n\\nThe above example indicates that clinical appointments benefit from service co-production between physicians and patients due to high variability in patient needs. Roels (2014) shows that when a task is less standard,  it  is  optimal  to  increase  interaction  between  the  service  provider  and  customer.  Management literature has previously discussed the benefits of reduced rework with increasing customer engagement (Lengnick-Hall 1996).\\n\\nDespite  these  disadvantages,  surveys  of  physicians  indicate  that  they  prefer  to  perform  some prework on EHR before an appointment. Particularly,\\n\\n- \\uf0b7 I find it useful to know the purpose of the visit and the scope of the patient\\'s concerns and to review the data before the appointment. This allows me to formulate a tentative plan before I enter the exam room and makes it less likely that some aspect of care will fall through the cracks. Spending a few minutes reviewing the chart and patient questionnaire and discussing the patient with the nurse pays off with a more efficient, focused visit (Sinsky 2016).\\n- \\uf0b7 I feel that preparation ahead of the visit is the key (Zhang et al. 2016).\\n\\nWhile some EHR work would always be done with the patient in the room, prework may help reduce the total EHR workload. First, doing some prework would be an example of early initiation of tasks. Early task initiation shifts the workload from more congested parts of the workday to an earlier non-valueadded idle time and may reduce total processing time (Batt and Terwiesch 2017). Time with the patient in the examination room is a busy time for the physician. They must listen to the patient, review and type\\n\\npatient-supplied information into EHR, and recommend treatment options. Doing some EHR work, such as  reviewing  patient  history  and  preparing  notes  before  entering  the  room,  may  help  reduce  the  time physicians spend alternating between talking to the patient and interacting with the EHR system. This would help the physician perform the remaining EHR work with the patient in the room more efficiently.  This improvement in efficiency by moving tasks from busy server time is also related to the lean concept of changeover reduction by doing external setup tasks when the machine is stopped (Shingo 1989, Costa et al. 2013). EHR tasks such as reviewing patient records and selecting templates 2 in the EHR system can be thought of as setup tasks, and performing them before the appointment would help reduce the time spent on EHR during the appointment.\\n\\nSecondly, research in psychology has indicated that although switching costs are incurred when switching between tasks, the switching cost reduces (although it is not eliminated) when workers are given an opportunity to prepare for the switch (Verbruggen et al. 2007). Task preparation may be considered as the activation of mental structures in anticipation of their future use, such as collecting one\\'s thoughts before a lecture or collecting tools before a manual task, making the process progress more efficiently (Altmann 2004). Therefore, doing some prework, such as reviewing patient records, would help the physician be mentally prepared and help them do the multitasking part of EHR work in a more efficient manner. Given that prework could potentially lead to an increase or decrease in total EHR work, we propose the following hypotheses:\\n\\nHypothesis 1a . An increase in pre-appointment EHR work leads to less total time spent on EHR. Hypothesis 1b . An increase in pre-appointment EHR work leads to more total time spent on EHR.\\n\\nPhysician  burnout  from  EHR  activities  is  related  to  total  EHR  workload  and  after-work  hours (Sinsky et al. 2016, Attipoe 2021). In our second hypothesis, we try to measure the effect of prework on EHR workload after the end of the day. As we remarked in the discussion above, prework may increase the total EHR workload due to Parkinson\\'s law, task-switching, and rework due to low service co-production. Prior studies have found that knowledge workers often batch similar tasks, and this batching behavior is positively associated with increasing workload (Ibanez et al. 2018). Therefore, if prework increases the total EHR workload, it may also lead to increased after-work hours due to batching of EHR tasks to the end of the day. Also, with an increasing workload, physicians may prefer not to be rushed during clinic hours and do these additional tasks after the end of the workday (Attipoe 2021).\\n\\nOn the contrary, performing prework may reduce the end-of-day work since the physician is more prepared for the appointment. This may lead to reduced errors in EHR work during the appointment and, therefore, less EHR work during after-work hours. We hypothesize the following:\\n\\nHypothesis 2a. An increase in pre-appointment EHR work leads to less end-of-day EHR work.\\n\\nHypothesis 2b. An increase in pre-appointment EHR work leads to more end-of-day EHR work.\\n\\nWe next consider the effect of postwork on the total EHR workload. After the conclusion of the appointment, the physician performs several actions on the EHR system. These are typically tasks such as writing after-visit notes, ordering tests, sending medication orders to pharmacies, and communicating with the  patient  over  secure  communication  about  the  summary  of  the  visit  and  any  recommendations.  A physician may choose to complete this work as postwork in the idle time between appointments or wait until the end of the day.\\n\\nThere  are  three  reasons  postwork  would  lead  to  an  increase  in  total  EHR  time.  First,  if  the physicians stop doing the postwork of the focal appointment when the next patient is ready, then it would lead to an interruption in the EHR activity of the focal appointment. Froehle and White (2014) show that interruptions can induce forgetting in a worker leading to increased rework to complete the task. Second, similar to prework, introducing postwork may also lead to the detrimental effect of task switching from face-to-face  appointment  to  EHR  work,  introducing  changeover  time  when  starting  postwork  EHR. Postwork EHR introduces changeover time like prework EHR, however, without the advantages of task preparation. Lastly, physicians may prefer easier tasks when selecting EHR tasks to perform during the post-appointment time. Selecting easier tasks has been associated with lower productivity (KC et al. 2020, Ibanez et al. 2018). Therefore, the time taken to complete EHR work for the appointment may go up if the physician selects easier EHR tasks during the postwork period.\\n\\nThere are three advantages to performing EHR tasks during idle time after an appointment. First, shifting  EHR-related  activity  to  after  the  appointment  may  help  reduce  information  overload  (KarrWisniewski and Lu 2010) for the physician during the appointment. Doing dedicated EHR work during idle time without interference from patient interaction may lead to improved efficiency in doing EHR work. Second, when compared to end-of-day work, the physician may have better recall during regular work hours and thus  may  be  able  to  complete  EHR  tasks  faster.  Operations  management  literature  has  previously identified the productivity benefits of improved recall. Third, the physician may need to collaborate with the nurse or other care providers while filling in the information in EHR or may need technical assistance on the EHR system itself. In that case, it is preferable to complete tasks during regular work hours. Afterwork coordination and communication may need to be done asynchronously, as not everyone is available. Recent  studies  on  work  from  home  of  information  workers  have  shown  that  increased  asynchronous\\n\\ncommunication leads to slower information sharing (Yang et al. 2022). Considering the effect of postwork on total EHR usage, we have the following hypotheses:\\n\\nHypothesis 3a. An increase in post-appointment EHR work leads to less total EHR workload.\\n\\nHypothesis 3b. An increase in post-appointment EHR work leads to more total EHR workload.\\n\\nAs discussed above, postwork may increase the total EHR workload, and as discussed previously, workers tend to batch tasks with increasing workload, which may increase after-work hours. On the other hand, postwork helps shift work from after-work hours and may improve EHR productivity as longer work hours have been associated with lower productivity (Caruso 2014). Given these factors, we hypothesize:\\n\\nHypothesis 4a. An increase in post-appointment EHR leads to less end-of-day EHR workload.\\n\\nHypothesis 4b. An increase in post-appointment EHR leads to more end-of-day EHR workload.\\n\\nPhysicians have considerable discretion on how they choose to distribute EHR activity before, after, or during appointments or after the end of the workday (Zhang 2016, Attipoe 2021). In the following two hypotheses, we consider whether increasing the idle time between appointments would lead to changes in the amount of prework and postwork.\\n\\nWe first consider the effect of idle time on prework. Research in psychology has demonstrated that when presented with an opportunity to prepare for upcoming tasks to reduce task-switching costs, workers may fail  to  do  so.  This  may  happen  due  to  a  lack  of  motivation,  fatigue,  or  lack  of  feedback  on  the performance benefits of preparation (De Jong 2000). Short breaks can benefit productivity (Pendem et al. 2022), and physicians may wish to take benefit of these short breaks to rejuvenate themselves rather than work on EHR. Lastly, since there is a possibility that the upcoming appointment may be a no-show, the physician may not do prework to avoid wasted effort.\\n\\nOn the  other  hand,  increasing  the  idle  time  before  an  appointment  may  lead  to  the  physician spending more time on prework. The physician may be aware of the productivity benefits of prework and may do so when given an opportunity. The physician may prefer to spend more face time with the patient and perform more prework EHR work when the idle time before an appointment increases. In the context of  hand  hygiene,  Dai  et  al.  (2015)  show  that  when  there  is  time  off  between  shifts,  the  time  spent  on secondary tasks goes up.  Given these effects, we present the following hypotheses:\\n\\nHypothesis 5a. An increase in the average idle time between preceding appointments leads to more preappointment EHR time for the focal appointment.\\n\\nHypothesis 5b. An increase in the average idle time between preceding appointments leads to less preappointment EHR time for the focal appointment.\\n\\nIncreasing idle time after an appointment may not lead to any increase in postwork. Physicians may procrastinate any remaining EHR tasks for the appointment to the end of the day and utilize idle time for rejuvenation. Secondly, the physician may prefer to batch EHR tasks to the end of the day. Batching of\\n\\ntasks by healthcare professionals has been observed in other healthcare contexts, such as radiology and the emergency department (Ibanez et al. 2017, Meng et al. 2021, and Feizi et al. 2022). Physicians may also prefer the flexibility of working from home (Attipoe 2021) and may not utilize the idle time for postwork.\\n\\nOn  the  other  hand,  several  factors  may  lead  to  increasing  postwork  with  increasing  idle  time between appointments. First, an increase in idle time between appointments may increase the likelihood of completing  a  patient\\'s  EHR-related  tasks  and  not  getting  interrupted  by  the  following  appointment.  If physicians are averse to interruptions and incomplete work, they may increase postwork activity if more time becomes available. Additionally, physicians may prefer to end the day early, spend more face time with  the  patients,  and  take  advantage  of  better  recall  immediately  after  the  appointment.  Thus,  with additional idle time after the appointment, physicians will utilize that to increase postwork. We present the following hypotheses:\\n\\nHypothesis 6a. An increase in average idle time after an appointment leads to more post-appointment work. Hypothesis 6b. An increase in average idle time after an appointment leads to less post-appointment work.\\n\\nWe tabulate the mechanisms through which prework and postwork may affect total and end-of-day time spent on EHR in Table 1.\\n\\nTable 1: Mechanisms of the effect of Prework and Postwork on Total and End-of-Day Time on EHR\\n\\n\\n## 4. Data\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4.1 Data Description\\n\\n\\nWe test our hypotheses using data from the Family Medicine unit of one of the largest Academic Medical  Centers  in  the  United  States.  The  Family  Medicine  unit  delivers  primary  care  services  in  an outpatient setting. All physicians are required to use the same EHR system provided by Epic Systems Inc. 3 Our data ranges from May 2017 through May 2019. We restrict our data to those days with at least five appointments  in  the  day,  as  days  with  less  than  five  appointments  are  not  representative  of  the  daily workload of the physicians. Our final data comprises 152,970 appointments from 74 physicians.\\n\\nEHR systems record time stamps of activities performed. This data is called audit log data or event log data. This data tracks who logged in to the EHR system, what task was performed, when they did the task, and the patient record on which it was performed. This audit data is recorded because of the HIPAA requirements to audit inappropriate access (Adler-Milstein et al. 2020). Several studies have validated the measurement of EHR use from audit log data through other means. Tai-Seale (2017) compared EHR audit log data by two means, in-person observation, and audio recording. Sinha et al. (2021) and Arndt et al. (2017) validated EHR time stamp data with observed data. These studies find the difference between EHR time stamp data and observed data of EHR usage to be small and recommend using audit log data to study clinic workflow and EHR use by physicians.\\n\\nWe have  two  separate  datasets  of  audit  log  data.  The  first  dataset  relates  to  the  appointment progression. This data consists of the following fields for each appointment: Patient ID,  Physician ID, Date of appointment, Age of patient, Gender of patient, Patient insurance provider, Scheduled start time of appointment, Start time of patient check-in at the front desk, Time patient enters an examination room, Time nurse leaves the examination room, Time physician enters the examination room, Diagnosis codes for visit and Time physician ends the appointment. The second dataset is EHR usage log data. This data has timestamps for each EHR action and the identifier for the patient whose records were being viewed or edited by the physician. This data consists of the following: Physician ID, Patient ID, EHR activity starting timestamp, and EHR activity name. Given Physician ID, Patient ID, appointment time stamps, and EHR activity time stamps, we can combine the two data sets to get the time spent on EHR activity for each patient between two given time limits. Next, we define the different time windows when physicians perform EHR tasks.\\n\\nPrework ( PRE ) is the amount of time a physician spends on a patient\\'s EHR record from 12:01 AM on the day of the appointment until the start of the face-to-face appointment. We ignore work done on EHR before 12:01 AM, as we observe that less than 0.01% of EHR work for an appointment is done on the previous  day.  Multitasking  ( MULTI )  EHR  time  is  spent  on  EHR  tasks  while  the  physician  is  in  the examination room with the patient. Postwork ( POST ) EHR activity is done between the end of the face-to-\\n\\nface appointment and the end of the workday. End-of-day ( EOD ) EHR activity denotes time spent on EHR after the end of the workday. We define the end of the workday as 6 pm because it is the standard practice in our setting and several studies define regular work hours for physicians to be between 8 am and 6 pm (Arndt et al. 2017, Sinha et al. 2021). We repeat our analysis with the physician workday ending at 5 pm, as used by Bavafa and Terwiesch (2019), and also by computing the end of the workday to be the end of the last appointment. Our findings do not change for these alternate definitions for the end of the workday.\\n\\nIn Figure 2, we show the representative timing of these EHR activities. The blocks above the central horizontal line represent the time physicians spend with patients in the room. We show five appointments, the second appointment is a no-show, and the fourth appointment has a delayed start, starting after its scheduled start time. For simplicity, we only show EHR activities of appointment 4. We show the timing of EHR activity in the blocks below the horizontal line. As discussed above, we can observe that physicians divide their EHR activity into prework ( PRE ), postwork ( POST ), multitasking work with the patient in the room ( MULTI ), and EHR work at the end of the day ( EOD ). We next describe the procedure of computing the time spent on EHR activity between given time intervals.\\n\\nFigure 2: Representative diagram of timing of appointments and EHR work for a physician\\'s day.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n\\n## 4.2 Data Transformation\\n\\n\\nOur unit of analysis is an appointment, and we analyze the timing of EHR usage relative to the appropriate appointment. For this, we transform the data so that for each appointment, we have the EHR work done during the intervals for PRE, MULTI, POST, and EOD. Next, we describe the steps to compute the duration of EHR activity done by a physician within these time intervals.\\n\\nFirst, we select the subset of EHR usage log data for the given Physician ID and Patient ID. Then we find all EHR activities where the activity time stamp falls within the start and end times of the required time interval. We order all these activities in increasing time. Let these activities be ( 𝑎ଵ , 𝑎 ଶ , … , 𝑎 ே ) and the corresponding time stamps be ( 𝑡 ଵ , 𝑡 ଶ , … , 𝑡 ே ).\\n\\nNext, we compute the duration of the activity 𝑎\\u0bdc by computing 𝑡 \\u0bdcାଵ -𝑡\\u0bdc . The timestamp for each activity is created by the EHR internal system when the physician interacts with the system. However, there is no direct way to ascertain how long the physician was active on the EHR system for a particular task. The physician may have the EHR open while engaging in other activities, such as talking to the patient or a colleague. To eliminate idle time where the system is open without any activity, we applied a cutoff of 90 seconds, i.e., for activity 𝑎\\u0bdc if 𝑡 \\u0bdcାଵ -𝑡\\u0bdc exceeds 90 seconds, we set it to 90 seconds. We used a 90-second cutoff as Arndt et al. (2017) validated that applying a 90-second cutoff supported observed data of physician EHR usage. Tai-Seale (2017) and Sinha et al. (2021) used a cutoff of 60 seconds. Both studies also validate the measurement from EHR audit logs against data from actual observations of physicians. To demonstrate that  our results are not sensitive to this cutoff threshold, we repeat our analysis for cutoff values of 60 seconds, 90 seconds, and 120 seconds. We present these results in the Electronic Companion (EC.3.2), showing that our principal findings do not change. We compute PRE, MULTI, POST , and EOD using the above procedure. Next, we will describe the definition of each variable and present descriptive statistics.\\n\\n\\n## 4.3 Variable Definitions and Descriptive Statistics\\n\\n\\nIn Table 1, we present the summary statistics. We have two dependent variables for our analysis . The first is the total time spent on EHR on an appointment on the day of the appointment ( TOTAL . ) The second dependent variable of interest is the time physicians spend on EHR systems after the end of the work day ( EOD . )\\n\\nWe have four principal endogenous variables for our analysis: PRE, MULTI, POST, and EOD. Our last  variable  of  interest  is  the  average  idle  time  between  appointments  after  the  index  appointment ( MeanIdleAfter ). We compute the duration between the end time of the index appointment and the start time of the subsequent appointment as the idle time after the index appointment. To compute the average idle time after the index appointment, we compute the average of all such idle times after the end of the index appointment. This variable will measure the time available to do post-appointment EHR tasks after an  appointment.  As MULTI may influence MeanIdleAfter ,  we  model MeanIdleAfter as  an  endogenous variable. Finally, we include the following control variables:\\n\\nPatient controls: Patient characteristics such as clinical complexity may determine how much time physicians spend outside clinical hours and during appointments on EHR systems (Zhang et al. 2016, Arndt et al. 2017). Therefore, we control for several patient-level factors, such as gender, age, and whether the patient has Medicaid, Medicare, or private insurance. We control for patient continuity by including an indicator  variable  if  the  patient  has  last  visited  the  same  physician  previously.  We  control  for  patient complexity by including a variable for the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), which is used frequently in the literature (Austin et al. 2015, KC and Tushe 2021). CCI measures the one-year mortality of patients by incorporating the acuity of several severe medical conditions and is expressed as an integer between 0 and\\n\\n13. We use the R package \\'comorbidity\\'  to convert the diagnosis codes of a visit to CCI scores. 4 Workload and scheduling controls: The clinical workload of the physician may influence the choice to allocate EHR work during work hours or after the end of the day. Therefore, we include the total number of appointments scheduled and the total scheduled duration of all appointments on the day. Additionally, we control for the appointment sequence because physicians\\' choices for allocating EHR tasks may vary for earlier and later appointments for the day. We include a control for the scheduled duration of the index appointment, as that may influence the physician\\'s choice to increase multitasking EHR activity during the appointment. We also control for the average  idle time between  appointments preceding the index appointment ( MeanIdleBefore). Other controls: We include fixed effects for physicians to control for time-invariant physician characteristics. We also include the day-of-week effect.\\n\\nTable 2: Descriptive Statistics at the Appointment Level\\n\\nNotes: N=152,970. Unit of analysis is an appointment. Other control variables not in the table: Physician FE, Patient Gender, Patient Age, Patient Insurance, Patient Continuity Indicator, and Day of Week\\n\\n\\n## 5. Econometric Model\\n\\n\\nOur observational dataset on physician EHR use is detailed and granular, allowing us to perform a process-level analysis. The patient ID labels EHR activity for a particular patient\\'s record. This allows us to connect the appointment progression and patient characteristics with the EHR use giving us a view into when EHR tasks were performed for a particular appointment.\\n\\nThe central challenge in using observational data to identify causal effects in our analyses arises from physicians\\' endogenous choice of when and how much EHR tasks to perform during idle time. While we control for factors such as daily workload and patient complexity, other unobservable patient factors may affect the total time on EHR and the work done during idle time. For example, if a patient expresses a severe mental health condition during the appointment, the physician would be more likely to spend face time with the patient than do EHR work while the patient is in the room (Zhang et al. 2016). This would likely increase POST and EOD while reducing MULTI . A patient having a severe mental health condition is also correlated with increased EHR usage by the physician (Young et al. 2018). Young et al. (2018) find that patients and physicians having linguistic and cultural similarities correlate with more face-to-face time and total EHR time. These examples indicate that using observational data of EHR time stamps would be challenging for our analysis. We address this problem by setting up an identifiable system of simultaneous equations accounting for the simultaneity bias among our key variables of interest. Through this system of equations,  we  model  the  relationship  between PRE , MULTI , POST , EOD ,  and  the  idle  time  between appointments. Through this system of equations, we estimate the effect of PRE and POST on TOTAL and EOD .\\n\\n\\n## 5.1 Model Formulation and Identification\\n\\n\\n𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑷𝑹𝑬𝒊 = 𝜶𝑨𝑫,𝑷𝑹𝑬𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑨𝒓𝒓𝑫𝒆𝒍𝒂𝒚𝒊 + 𝜶𝑷𝑫,𝑷𝑹𝑬𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑷𝑪𝑷𝑫𝒆𝒍𝒂𝒚𝒊 + 𝜶𝑰𝑩,𝑷𝑹𝑬𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑰𝒅𝒍𝒆𝑩𝒆𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒆 + 𝜽𝑷𝑹𝑬𝑿𝒊 + 𝝐𝑷𝑹𝑬,𝒊 (𝟏) 𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑴𝑼𝑳𝑻𝑰𝒊 = 𝜷𝑷𝑹𝑬,𝑴𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑷𝑹𝑬𝒊 + 𝜶𝑨𝑫,𝑴𝑼𝑳𝑻𝑰𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑨𝒓𝒓𝑫𝒆𝒍𝒂𝒚𝒊 + 𝜶𝑷𝑫,𝑴𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑷𝑪𝑷𝑫𝒆𝒍𝒂𝒚𝒊 + 𝜶𝑴𝑳𝑨𝑮,𝑴𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑳𝒂𝒈𝑴𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒊𝒊 + 𝜽𝑴𝑿𝒊 + 𝝐𝑴𝑼𝑳𝑻𝑰,𝒊 (𝟐) 𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑰𝒅𝒍𝒆𝑨𝒇𝒕𝒆𝒓 = 𝜷𝑷𝑹𝑬,𝑰𝑨𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑷𝑹𝑬𝒊 + 𝜶𝑨𝑫,𝑰𝑨𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑨𝒓𝒓𝑫𝒆𝒍𝒂𝒚𝒊 + 𝜷𝑴,𝑰𝑨𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑴𝑼𝑳𝑻𝑰𝒊 + 𝜶𝑵𝑨,𝑰𝑨𝑵𝒐𝑺𝒉𝒐𝒘𝑨𝒇𝒕𝒆𝒓 + 𝜽𝑰𝑨𝑿𝒊 + 𝝐𝑰𝑨,𝒊 (𝟑) 𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑷𝑶𝑺𝑻𝒊 = 𝜷𝑷𝑹𝑬,𝑷𝑶𝑺𝑻𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑷𝑹𝑬𝒊 + 𝜷𝑴𝑼𝑳𝑻𝑰,𝑷𝑶𝑺𝑻𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑴𝑼𝑳𝑻𝑰𝒊 + 𝜷𝑰𝑨,𝑷𝑶𝑺𝑻𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑰𝒅𝒍𝒆𝑨𝒇𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒊 + 𝜶𝑳𝑷𝑳𝒂𝒈𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑷𝑶𝑺𝑻 + 𝜽𝑷𝑶𝑺𝑻𝑿𝒊 + 𝝐𝑷𝑶𝑺𝑻,𝒊 (𝟒) 𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑬𝑶𝑫𝒊 = 𝜷𝑷𝑹𝑬,𝑬𝑶𝑫𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑷𝑹𝑬𝒊 + 𝜷𝑴𝑼𝑳𝑻𝑰,𝑬𝑶𝑫𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑴𝑼𝑳𝑻𝑰𝒊 + 𝜷𝑰𝑨,𝑬𝑶𝑫𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑰𝒅𝒍𝒆𝑨𝒇𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒊 + 𝜷𝑷𝑶𝑺𝑻,𝑬𝑶𝑫𝑳𝒐𝒈𝑷𝑶𝑺𝑻𝒊 + 𝜽𝑬𝑶𝑫𝑿𝒊 + 𝝐𝑬𝑶𝑫,𝒊 (𝟓)\\n\\nThese equations model the relationship between PRE MULTI MeanIdleAfter , , , POST , and EOD . We perform a log transformation for all variables that are a duration of an activity or a time interval. We use log transformation because it has been used to model service time in healthcare (KC and Terwiesch 2009). Gurvich et al. (2020) show that documentation time by physicians follows a log-normal distribution. The estimates (𝛽\\u0bc9ோா,ெ , 𝛽 \\u0bc9ோா,ூ\\u0bba , 𝛽 ெ,ூ\\u0bba , 𝛽 \\u0bc9ோா,\\u0bc9ைௌ் , 𝛽 ெ\\u0bce\\u0bc5்ூ,\\u0bc9ைௌ்  , 𝛽 ூ\\u0bba,\\u0bc9ைௌ் , 𝛽 \\u0bc9ோா,ாை\\u0bbd , 𝛽 ெ\\u0bce\\u0bc5்ூ,ாை\\u0bbd , 𝛽 ூ\\u0bba,ாை\\u0bbd , 𝛽\\u0bc9ைௌ்,ாை\\u0bbd ) give the relationship among the endogenous variables. The parameters (𝛼\\u0bba\\u0bbd,\\u0bc9ோா , 𝛼 \\u0bc9\\u0bbd,\\u0bc9ோா , 𝛼 ூ\\u0bbb,\\u0bc9ோா , 𝛼ெ\\u0bc5\\u0bbaீ,ெ , 𝛼 ே\\u0bba,ூ\\u0bba , 𝛼 \\u0bc5\\u0bc9 ) are  the  coefficients  of  the  exogenous  variables.  All\\n\\nother controls, such as patient controls, workload, and scheduling controls, are collected together in 𝑿𝒊 and the coefficients corresponding to these controls are (𝜃\\u0bc9ோா , 𝜃 ெ, 𝜃 ூ\\u0bba , 𝜃 \\u0bc9ைௌ் , 𝜃 ாை\\u0bbd ) . Finally, ( 𝜖 \\u0bc9ோா,\\u0bdc , 𝜖 ெ\\u0bce\\u0bc5்ூ,\\u0bdc , 𝜖 ூோ,\\u0bdc , 𝜖 \\u0bc9ைௌ்,\\u0bdc , 𝜖 ாை\\u0bbd,\\u0bdc ) are the error terms for each equation. Figure 3 illustrates the block diagram for the system of equations.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nWe first consider equation (1). With increasing idle time before an appointment, physicians would have more time to do prework. If this coefficient is positive, that would indicate that physicians utilize the idle time before an appointment to perform tasks on the EHR system before face-to-face time with the patient. If the physician is delayed for an appointment, the physician may reduce the time spent on prework. We note that physicians being delayed due to the previous appointment will be exogenous to physician EHR use for the index appointment. Next, in equation (2), we model the time spent on the EHR system while the patient is in the room to depend on prework and physician delay.\\n\\nThe  time  physicians  multitask  on  EHR  may  influence  the  idle  time  between  subsequent appointments. From this, we have equation (3). Depending on the effect of previous work done on EHR ( PRE , MULTI )  and  the  amount  of  idle  time  available  between  appointments  after  its  conclusion,  the physician may choose to perform some postwork. We model this by equation (4). Finally, depending on the effect of previous EHR tasks, the remaining EHR task is done after the end of the workday ( EOD) . We model this by equation (5).\\n\\nWe note that the system of equations above is recursive, where in each equation, only endogenous variables  from  the  previous  equations  appear  on  the right-hand  side  (Wooldridge  2010).  However,  the system of equation is not fully recursive because, as we discussed above, there may be unobserved patient characteristics that may influence both total EHR time spent on an appointment and the distribution of EHR tasks to PRE, MULTI,  POST , and EOD . Therefore, we cannot assume that the error terms ( 𝜖 \\u0bc9ோா,\\u0bdc , 𝜖 ெ\\u0bce\\u0bc5்ூ,\\u0bdc , 𝜖 ூோ,\\u0bdc , 𝜖 \\u0bc9ைௌ்,\\u0bdc , 𝜖 ாை\\u0bbd,\\u0bdc ) are  pairwise  uncorrelated.  Consequently,  for  the  system  to  be\\n\\nidentified, we include instrumental variables in addition to the variables discussed above. We define the instrumental variables below.\\n\\nPatient Arrival Delay ( ArrDelay ): This is the delay in patient arrival, computed by the time difference between the appointment\\'s scheduled start time and the patient\\'s check-in time.\\n\\nLagged Multitasking ( LagMULTI ): This is the time spent on EHR by the physician during an appointment ( MULTI ) on the previous day, which has the same sequence as the index appointment.\\n\\nNo Show After Appointment ( NoShowAfter ): Indicator variable if one of the scheduled appointments after the index appointment is a no-show.\\n\\nLagged Postwork ( LagPOST ): We compute this variable by taking the time spent on EHR by the physician after an appointment ( POST ) on the previous day, which has the same sequence as the index appointment.\\n\\nA valid instrument for a system of equations needs to satisfy specific requirements. First, it needs to be uncorrelated with all the error terms. Secondly, some of the exogenous variables must be excluded from some of the equations, i.e., not all exogenous variables can affect all of the endogenous variables directly. This requirement is called the exclusion requirement. For a system of equations to be identified, the exclusions must satisfy the order and rank conditions. The order condition for an equation states that the number of excluded exogenous variables from the equation must be greater than or equal to the number of  included  right-hand-side  endogenous  variables.  The  rank  condition  requires  that  the  matrix  of  all structural equations of the model have full rank. A detailed discussion of these requirements is available in Wooldridge (2010), Chapter 9. We discuss our choice of instrumental variables and their validity below.\\n\\nFirst, for equation (1), we include patient arrival delay. If a patient arrives late for an appointment, that will give time for the physician to do additional prework. Similar to physician arrival delay, patient arrival delay may impact MULTI and the IdleAfter but is unlikely to be correlated with the error terms for the equations for POST or EOD. For equation (2), we include the logged transformation of LagMULTI, which is MULTI for the appointment on the previous day of the physician, which had the same sequence as the index appointment. Using lagged variables as instrumental variables is a common practice (Kesavan et al. 2014, Tan and Netessine 2014). We also used an alternate construction of LagMULTI by computing the average  lagged  multitasking  EHR  for  the  physician\\'s  appointments  on  the  previous  day.  Our  results remained the same.\\n\\nNext, in equation (3), we use the indicator variable NoShowAfter, which denotes the presence of a no-show appointment after the index appointment. The information that an appointment is a no-show is available only at the start of that appointment. Therefore, it is unlikely that the presence of a no-show following the index appointment would be correlated with unobservable patient characteristics of the index appointment. Lastly, we used LagLogPOST for equation (4). LagPOST is the lagged variable for POST and is computed similarly to LagMULTI.\\n\\nWe can  verify  through  observation  that  our  system  of  equations  satisfies  the  order  condition because, for all equations, the number of excluded exogenous variables from the equation is greater than the number of included right-hand-side endogenous variables. We use the Stata package \\'checkreg3\\' (Baum 2007) to verify that all the equations satisfy the rank condition.  Our estimation procedure is based on the Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) estimation procedure for simultaneous equations described in Wooldridge (2010). We describe the estimation steps in the electronic companion (EC.1). We cluster robust standard error by Physician and Date of Appointment.\\n\\nAs a part of our robustness tests, we also show results from estimating our model using the threestage least squares (3SLS) estimator (Zellner and Theil 1992) (EC.3.4), and we observe that parameter estimates  show  only  minor  differences  from  the  2SLS  estimation.  We  also  present  results  on  tests  of endogeneity (EC.3.5) and show that the results support endogeneity in the system of equations. In the next section, we discuss our results and their managerial relevance.\\n\\n\\n## 6. Results and Discussion\\n\\n\\nIn  Table  3,  we  present  the  estimated  parameters  of  our  system  of  equations.  The  dependent variables label the columns, and the column numbers correspond to equations (1)-(5). The right-hand-side variables of the corresponding equations label the rows. We have rows for all endogenous variables and, for conciseness, include only a subset of the exogenous variables. From the estimates of equation (1), we observe that as the idle time before an appointment increases, the physicians increase PRE . A small but significant increase in PRE is also observed when patients check in after their scheduled appointment start time. This also suggests that when physicians have time available before an appointment, they are likely to increase PRE. When physicians are delayed, they reduce PRE . This suggests that a more congested schedule with less idle time for physicians would lead to physicians reducing PRE.\\n\\nFrom equation (2), we observe that an increase in PRE leads to a reduction in MULTI. As comments by Sinsky (2016), literature on task preparation and early-task initiation suggest, this could be due to the advantages of early-task initiation and task preparation . In column (3), we observe that a no-show after an appointment increases the idle time between appointments. However, if a physician arrives late to the index appointment, the effect of physician delay persists beyond the completion of the index appointment by reducing the idle time following the appointment. Finally, from estimates for LogEOD in column (5), we observe that increasing PRE, MULTI, and POST reduces EHR work from after-work hours.\\n\\nWhile the above-discussed effects are statistically significant, due to the logarithmic transformation of variables, the interpretation of these coefficients is not obvious. Furthermore, we want to estimate the marginal impact of PRE and POST on total EHR time spent, which is also not evident from these estimates. Therefore,  next,  we  compute  the  marginal  effects  corresponding  to  these  coefficients  and  the  overall marginal effect of PRE and POST on TOTAL .\\n\\nTable 3: Summary Regression Results for Simultaneous Equation Model Equations (1)-(5)\\n\\nStandard errors in parentheses Notes: N=152,970.

In the electronic companion, we show the computation of the overall marginal effect of PRE and POST on TOTAL from the coefficients of the system of equations. From equations (1) and (4), we compute the marginal effect of MeanIdleBefore and MeanIdleAfter on PRE and POST. We present these in Tables 4 and 5.\\n\\nTable 4: Marginal Effects at Mean of Prework and Postwork on End of Day Work and Total EHR work\\n\\nTable 5: Marginal Effects at Mean Idle Time on Prework and Postwork EHR Work\\n\\nWe observe that a unit increase in PRE decreases EOD by 0.167 units and TOTAL by 0.391 units. Therefore, we find support for Hypotheses 1a and 2a. The advantages of PRE , such as task preparation and early task initiation, outweigh the additional time spent doing PRE and any task changeover time introduced by doing more prework between appointments. The managerial relevance of these estimates is that if a physician increases PRE for an appointment by 5 minutes, then the sum of MULTI, POST, and EOD reduces by 6.9 minutes. In other words, a 5-minute increase in PRE reduces TOTAL by 1.9 minutes, a decrease of 10.4%. A 5-minute increase in PRE reduces EOD by 0.8 minutes, a decrease of 45%. In our setting, with 74 physicians who, on average, have 13 appointments per day, this translates into 21 fewer hours of endof-day EHR work.\\n\\nA unit  increase  in POST decreases EOD by  0.317  units,  which  leads  to  an  overall  increase  in TOTAL of 0.683 units. Therefore, we find support for hypotheses 4a and 3b. The disadvantages of POST include the interruption effects of subsequent appointments, meaning that the reduction in EOD does not outweigh the additional work done during POST. If a physician spends 5 additional minutes doing POST for  an  appointment, EOD will  decrease  by  1.3  minutes,  a  reduction  of  72%.  However,  the  total  EHR workload would go up by 3.6 minutes, an increase of 19.4%. We can observe that POST has a greater marginal effect on EOD as compared to the effect of PRE on EOD. This is possibly due to the fact that the physician has similar information regarding the patient visit when doing POST and EOD. Due to this, POST and EOD efforts are substitutable to a greater extent than PRE and EOD.\\n\\nFrom the above results, we estimate that increasing prework has the potential to significantly reduce both total and end-of-day EHR activity time for physicians. While postwork reduces end-of-day EHR time significantly  more  than  prework,  postwork  comes  at  the  cost  of  increased  overall  EHR  workload.  Our results are interesting as they demonstrate the differential impact of doing the secondary task as a pre or postwork. In fact, while prior literature on managing primary and secondary tasks, such as Legros et al. (2020) and EHR documentation tasks (Gurvich et al. 2020), has not differentiated prework and postwork, in our context we find that prework strictly dominates postwork.\\n\\nGiven  the  relative  advantages  of  prework  and  postwork,  hospital  administrators  may  consider providing protected time for EHR tasks depending on the outcomes required. If the objective is to reduce both total and end-of-day EHR workload, more focus can be placed on increasing prework. If the focus is on decreasing end-of-day time, a greater emphasis can be placed on postwork. After-hours EHR work has been identified as a significant contributor to physician fatigue (Adler-Milstein et al. 2020) and burnout (Robertson et al. 2017). Therefore, while postwork may increase total EHR work, its impact on reducing after-hours EHR work may still make postwork attractive.\\n\\nWhile considering increasing protected time for EHR tasks, an important consideration would be if  physicians would actually make use of the protected time to do EHR tasks. Due to the observational nature of our data, we can only provide insights into increases in unscheduled idle times. It is likely that physician  behavior  may  change  if  physicians  are  informed  of  an  increase  in  the  idle  time  between appointments ex-ante and are offered encouragement to use this time towards PRE and POST. Further research is required into the effect of scheduled idle time on pre and post-appointment EHR time.\\n\\nFrom our analysis of unscheduled idle time, we find that physicians show an increase in PRE and POST with increasing idle time before and after an appointment . We note that the overall marginal effect of MeanIdleBefore on PRE is smaller than that of MeanIdleAfter on POST .      An  increase of 5 minutes between the preceding appointment increases PRE by 7 seconds. On the other hand, an increase of 5 minutes between following appointments increases POST by 2 minutes. Our data suggest that physicians increase\\n\\nboth PRE and POST when presented with unscheduled increases in idle time. Therefore, we find support for Hypotheses 5a and 6a.  While we find that prework is a dominating strategy; however, with increasing idle time, physicians spend more time on postwork than prework.\\n\\n## 6.2 Alternative Explanation of Relationship between Prework and Total EHR Time\\n\\nIn our analysis, increasing prework reduces total EHR time. There are two possible explanations for this. The first explanation is that physicians are more productive with increasing prework due to task preparation and early task initiation advantages. An alternative explanation is that prework may be a loadbased response mechanism; therefore, the negative association between PRE and TOTAL may be due to task reduction. Previous literature has identified the relationship between increased load and eroding service standards (Olivia  and  Sterman 2001, KC and  Terwiesch 2012). To assess this question, we examine a different measure of EHR work - word count. Given the patient identifying information in the provider notes, we are not able to access them directly. However, we obtained precise word counts of the progress notes, patient instructions, and all other notes entered by the physician for each appointment. We use this word count as a proxy measure of EHR quality. If the decrease in TOTAL from increasing PRE is a result of task reduction, we should find a negative association between EHR word count and PRE. Controlling for all workload, physician, and patient characteristics described in Section 4.3, we find that an increase in PRE is associated with an increase in the total word count. Although careful qualitative analysis of all notes would be necessary to fully rule out the alternative explanation, this finding helps mitigate concerns that the negative relationship between PRE and TOTAL is from task reduction. We provide the result of this analysis in the Electronic Companion (EC.4)\\n\\n\\n## 7. Discussion and Conclusion\\n\\n\\n\\n## 7.1 Discussion\\n\\n\\nPhysician burnout is at an all-time high, with over 68% of physicians in the US reporting burnout in 2021.  In the U.S., the cost of physician turnover from burnout has been estimated to be between $2.8bn 5 to $6.3bn per year (Han et al. 2019). Several studies have identified the significant impact of EHR workload on physician burnout. However, operational suggestions for reducing this workload have been relatively unexplored. We investigate the impact of the structure of EHR work during a physician\\'s day. We find that doing EHR work in preparation for the upcoming appointment is a dominating strategy and can reduce a physician\\'s total and after-hours time on EHR. Doing EHR work after an appointment can significantly reduce after-hours EHR time, however, at the cost of increasing the total EHR workload. We find that idle time between appointments is an important driver of how physicians structure their daily EHR workload.\\n\\nIncreasing  idle  time  between  appointments  increases  both  pre-appointment  and  post-appointment  EHR workload. However, post-appointment EHR work increases to a greater degree.\\n\\nOur  findings  are  also  relevant  to  several  other  service  contexts.  Service  operators  often  must manage secondary tasks in addition to the primary task with customer interaction. Examples include data entry between calls for call center operators, working on insurance claim investigations between customer interactions  for  insurance  agents,  hand  washing  for  surgeons,  and  collaboration  with  other  physicians between inpatient rounds for hospitalists. These secondary tasks are related to the primary task; however, service  operators  have  greater  discretion  when  they  choose  to  do  them.  Our  results  show  when  these secondary tasks are done during the day determines the total and after-hours secondary task workload.\\n\\nWe make the following four principal contributions. First, we contribute to physician EHR use literature  by  quantifying  the  impact  of  pre  and  post-appointment  EHR  work  during  idle  time  between appointments. EHR use literature has focused on the overall impact of increasing EHR workload. We add to this literature by measuring the impact of the structure of EHR work during the day. We find that preappointment and post-appointment EHR tasks have different impacts on total and end-of-day EHR work. Pre-appointment  EHR  tasks  reduce  both  total  and  end-of-day  EHR  workload.  This  suggests  that  the advantages of pre-appointment EHR tasks, such as better preparation and early task initiation, outweigh the costs  of  increased  task  switching  from  documentation  to  face-to-face  activities.  While  interviews  with physicians have qualitatively indicated these factors, through our analysis, we are able to provide a rigorous quantitative  analysis  of  the  positive  impact  of  pre-appointment  EHR  work.  We  also  find  that  postappointment EHR tasks significantly reduce end-of-day EHR. The marginal reduction of end-of-day EHR time is greater from increasing post-appointment EHR tasks than from increasing pre-appointment EHR tasks. This is likely because the physician has similar information regarding the appointment when doing post-appointment and end-of-day EHR activities. Therefore, end-of-day EHR time can be easily substituted by post-appointment EHR. However, increasing post-appointment EHR tasks leads to an increase in total time  spent  on  EHR.  This  suggests  that  the  disadvantages  of  post-appointment  EHR  work,  such  as interruption due to following appointments and task switching, outweigh the advantages of reducing the end-of-day EHR workload.\\n\\nSecond, we contribute to task selection literature in operations management which has discussed the structure of work and the trade-offs involved in strategies such as multitasking, batching, and early-task initiation. Many of these studies have focused on the workload from the primary task. However, like the EHR workload for physicians, in many services, the workload due to secondary tasks is significant, and we study the operational impact of the structure of secondary tasks. Our findings show that the total time spent on secondary tasks depends on how service operators structure secondary work before, during, and after an appointment. Doing secondary tasks before an appointment may help reduce the time spent on secondary\\n\\ntasks by taking advantage of task preparation and early task initiation. Increasing secondary tasks after an appointment significantly reduces after-work hours; however, post-appointment secondary tasks may be interrupted  by  the  following  appointment  and  may  lead  to  an  overall  increase  in  total  time  spent  on secondary tasks due to interruption-driven inefficiencies.\\n\\nIn addition to contributing to theory, our findings have important implications for practice.  Service designers can use these insights to create workflows for service operators managing primary and secondary tasks to improve server productivity and reduce after-work hours. The impact of the structure of secondary tasks on operational performance, such as makespan and after-work hours, will have relevance in a wide variety of service contexts. For clinics, these insights will help healthcare administrators in primary care create EHR workflows and appointment schedules that reduce burnout due to EHR workload. The idle time between appointments can be increased to increase both pre-appointment and post-appointment EHR time. The varying effects of pre and post-appointment EHR work suggest that the recommended use of idle time would  depend  on  the  clinic\\'s  objective.  If  the  objective  is  to  reduce  the  total  EHR  workload,  greater emphasis can be placed on doing pre-appointment EHR tasks. If the objective is to reduce end-of-day EHR time, then increasing post-appointment EHR work would give a greater marginal benefit, although at the cost of increasing total EHR time.\\n\\nOur results have significant implications for the theory and practice of appointment scheduling. Scheduling  literature  for  services  has  typically  focused  on  customer  interaction  time  and  has  not incorporated the workload from these secondary tasks. In the appointment scheduling literature, an increase in idle time is often associated with an increase in makespan. However, as we observe from our results, idle time between appointments may be used to perform pre and post-appointment secondary tasks. Given our findings that prework and postwork effects both total time spent on secondary tasks and after-hours time, an important question is how does idle time affect physician makespan in the presence of secondary tasks like EHR. Since makespan is a day-level measure for a physician, we perform the following analysis to answer this question.\\n\\n\\n## 7.2 Impact of Increasing Idle Time Between Appointments on Physician Makespan\\n\\n\\nOur results show that increasing idle time increases PRE and POST. We also observe PRE and POST reduce EOD and POST increases TOTAL . So, the overall effect of performing EHR tasks in idle time on TOTAL is not obvious.  To estimate the combined effect of increasing idle time, we conduct an analysis on the impact of increasing idle time between appointments on physician makespan, where makespan also includes the end-of-day time spent by the physician on EHR systems. Since makespan for a physician is a day-level measure, our unit of measure for this analysis is physician-day.\\n\\nThe  components  of  our  model  are  as  follows:  our  outcome  of  interest  is  the  makespan  for  a physician ( 𝑃ℎ𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑀𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛) . We define makespan as the sum of face time with patients, idle time\\n\\nbetween appointments, and end-of-day EHR time. We compute this by calculating the time difference between the end of the last appointment of a physician\\'s day and the start of the first appointment. Then we add the total end-of-day EHR work for the physician\\'s appointments. Our primary independent variable is the amount of idle time between appointments ( 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐷𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦𝐼𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒) . We compute the idle time between two consecutive appointments by the time difference between an appointment\\'s end and the subsequent appointment\\'s  start.  We  then  sum  these  idle  times  for  all  appointments  of  a  physician\\'s  day  to  get 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐷𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦𝐼𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 . We define the variable PhysicianWorking as the difference between makespan and the idle time, i.e., ( 𝑃ℎ𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 = 𝑃ℎ𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑀𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛 - 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐷𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦𝐼𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑇𝑖𝑒 ). We control for the number of appointments scheduled in the day, the total scheduled duration of appointments, the average age of patients on the day, average patient complexity (as measured by CCI) of the day, the average number of patients having Medicare insurance, day of the week, and physician fixed effects. The summary statistics of all variables are in the Electronic Companion (EC.5).\\n\\nOur  econometric  model  is  as  follows, 𝑝 indicates  physician, 𝑗 indicates  day.  The  vector 𝒀𝒑𝒋 represents the control variables and 𝛿\\u0be3\\u0bdd indicates the error term. The coefficient 𝛽ூ,ௐ signifies the effect of increasing a physician\\'s total idle time in a day on the non-idle time of a physician\\'s makespan.\\n\\n## 𝐿𝑜𝑔൫𝑃ℎ𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔\\u0be3\\u0bdd൯ = 𝛽ூ,ௐ 𝐿𝑜𝑔൫𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐷𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦𝐼𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒\\u0be3\\u0bdd൯ + 𝜸𝒀𝒑𝒋 + 𝛿 \\u0be3\\u0bdd    (𝟔)\\n\\nThere may be unobserved patient and appointment characteristics that may influence both total idle time and physician makespan. For example, as discussed before, if a patient has a serious mental health condition and discusses that with the physician during the appointment, it may lead to more time spent with the patient in the room, consequently leading to less idle time following the appointment. Since mental health conditions correlate with higher EHR use, the end-of-day EHR time would be higher, leading to a longer  makespan.  We  use  the  instrumental  variables  approach  to  circumvent  the  possibility  that 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐷𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦𝐼𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 may be endogenous. We use the number of no-shows on the physician\\'s day as our instrumental variable. We estimate our modeling using the 2SLS procedure. The first stage is given by:\\n\\n## 𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐷𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦𝐼𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒\\u0be3\\u0bdd ) = 𝛽 \\u0bbb,\\u0bbd\\u0bc5 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑁𝑜𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑤𝑠\\u0be3\\u0bdd + 𝜸𝒀𝒑𝒋 + 𝜙\\u0be3\\u0bdd      (𝟕)\\n\\nWe show the results of regression analysis and the computation of the marginal effect of total daily idle time on physician makespan in the Electronic Companion (EC.5). We find that if the total idle time increase by 5 minutes in a day, the physician makespan decreases by 0.55 minutes. Therefore, pre and postappointment  EHR  time  may  be  increased  through  increasing  idle  time  without  negatively  impacting makespan.\\n\\nIdle  time  between  appointments  allows  the  service  operator  to  perform    EHR  as  prework  and postwork. Our results in Section 6 show that prework and postwork can reduce after-hours work.  Therefore,\\n\\nfor at least small increases in idle time, the makespan for the physician reduces due to the reduction in afterhours work.\\n\\n\\n## 7.3 Limitations\\n\\n\\nOur study has some limitations. First, our analysis is from a primary care setting. Physicians in other settings, such as inpatients, Emergency Department (ED), and surgery, may behave differently from primary care physicians when managing EHR workload. Physicians in an inpatient and ED setting do not have scheduled appointments and often do not have the opportunity to perform prework. Therefore, our findings may not be valid in that context. Secondly, when physicians perform tasks after work, whether they are in the clinic performing these tasks or at home is not observable. Physicians use Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to connect to EHR systems when located outside the clinic. To demarcate after-hours work, we rely on the current practice in our setting and prior literature (Bavafa and Terwiesch, 2019) to set a standard time for the end of the day. We also repeat our analysis for alternative definitions of end-of-day. Lastly, since we utilize EHR audit logs to measure physician EHR use, it will be an approximate measure of time spent on the EHR system. We use a cut-off time of 90 seconds to remove the idle time between EHR tasks. This method has been validated through several other observational studies.\\n\\n\\n## 7.4 Conclusion\\n\\n\\nSeveral  recent  studies  in  healthcare  literature  have  determined  that  workload  due  to  EHR contributes significantly to physician burnout. However, the operational implications of physician EHR usage behavior have not been rigorously studied. We contribute to the literature on healthcare operations by  analyzing  detailed  data  on  physician  EHR  usage.  We  find  that  pre-appointment  EHR  work  is  a dominating  strategy  reducing  both  total  and  after-hours  EHR  time.  Post-appointment  EHR  work significantly reduces after-hours EHR work, however, at the cost of increasing total EHR time. We find that when the idle time between appointments increases, physicians increase pre and post-appointment EHR work. However, they focus more on post-appointment EHR work. To assess the overall impact of increasing idle time between appointments, we find that in the presence of secondary tasks like EHR, a physician\\'s makespan may be reduced by increasing the idle time between appointments.\\n\\nOur  findings  also  contribute  broadly  to  operations  management  literature  by  studying  the implications of the structure of secondary work on workload and makespan. Our results have implications for the theory of task selection and appointment scheduling. Additionally, our results will provide insights to managers when creating schedules in the presence of a secondary task workload.\\n\\n'"

Introduction An Electronic Health Record (EHR) System is the digitized version of a patient's medical chart record containing medical history, diagnoses, treatment plans, immunization records, and test results. 1 EHRs reduce diagnostic errors and patient safety concerns (Graber et al. 2017, Hydari et al. 2019). EHRs also improve coordination and integration of care by providing real-time data at the point of care, efficient transfer of information across settings, and physician decision-su\""
